# Task Group for scripts

This originally came up as part of the scripts migration task that is in the work.

When running scripts from a task group using the bash task with **FILE PATH**, and require environment variables to be defined.
The goal is to be able to expose variables that are used as environment variables inside scripts.

From [This Github Issue Link](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-devops-docs/issues/3355#issuecomment-519381328) we can learn that it's no possible to define Azure DevOps 'Parameters' as environment variables in a release.

In order to overcome this issue: follow the below steps.

### Use the "Command Line" task

### And exported each variables to env

Export the environment variables using the inline mode of the "Command Line" Script.
Then run the scripts as you normally would in an file path task.
