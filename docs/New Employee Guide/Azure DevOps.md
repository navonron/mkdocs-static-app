Make sure you can access https://dev.azure.com/PDA-PDSS

Access to Azure DevOps should be automatic as part of the "DevOps Team" PDL.

## Step-by-step guide

1. Ask you sponsor for access (since this is not an AGS or IEM2 role)
2. Go to the link and check you if can login and view the iBI project.

Login with your Intel account to view the project.
For DevOps, you need to be able to see the "iBI" & "DevOps" projects.
