This wiki is designed to provide valuable insights and support to help you succeed in the ever-evolving world of DevOps in our business unit.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that aim to bridge the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). By fostering collaboration, automation, and continuous feedback, DevOps enables teams to deliver high-quality software at a faster pace. Embracing a DevOps culture encourages a shared responsibility for software delivery, from the initial development stages to deployment and maintenance, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced errors.
