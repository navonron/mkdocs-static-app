# 2023-07-30 - K8s 1.22

## **Summary**
tcp-services based services (Kafka, RabbitMQ) stopped working after GER Kuberenetes version upgrade.

## **Details**

In 30-07-2023, CaaS upgraded the Kubernetes version in GER Kuberenetes from version 1.20 to 1.22.

### **Issues**

- All tcp-services (linked to nginx-ingress-controller) services stopped working for all services that do not point to the 80,443,8443 ports.
- It seems like the header changes to the nginx-ingress-controller were also reverted, which caused more users to experience the header issue.

### **Affected Services**
- Kafka 
- RabbitMQ
- Users with a large header (?)
- Login and other Gateway services


### **Debugging**
When running the command `netstat -anp | grep 9094` on and IIL server (which currently has the newer k8s version) we get no output

But when the same command was ran on an AMR server (which wasn't upgraded) we did get a match

## **Solution**
### **Temporary Solution**
A Temporary solution to the Kafka issue was to add the Kafka NodePort Service to the Load Balancer in HighWire.

So even if CaaS upgrade the AMR cluster (which they didn't do yet). the tcp-services endpoints will stop working but HighWire will fallback to NodePort.

---

To provide a permanent solution we need to modify the cluster (according to An issue on GitHub [Link to Issue](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35943)).

***"K8s >= 1.21, hostNetwork: true needs to be set for tcp-services and udp-services to work."***

Since we are not able to modify the cluster, I opened a ticket to CaaS to assist with the issue.

### **Permanent Solution**

According to an article form the Rancher documentation [Ingress Configuration](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.6/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-resources-setup/load-balancer-and-ingress-controller/ingress-configuration):

*For Kubernetes v1.21 and up, the NGINX Ingress controller no longer runs in hostNetwork by default. It instead uses hostPorts for port 80 and port 443, so you can configure the admission webhook to be accessible only through the ClusterIP. This ensures that the webhook is only accessible from within the cluster.

Because of this change to the controller, the default behavior no longer sets hostNetwork to true. However, you must set hostNetwork to true for TCP- and UDP-based Services to work.*

For this above solution to work, and be future proof (so future changes wont remove that entry) we needed to add the following section to the cluster yaml:

``` yaml
spec:
  rancherKubernetesEngineConfig:
    ingress:
      defaultBackend: true
      defaultIngressClass: true
      networkMode: hostNetwork
```

Then again, two servers are have an issue saying the port 443 is already in use, so need you to reboot them so that fixes the issue: icsl7100 and icsl6667

#### **Steps**

1. Navigate to the Daemonset of nginx-ingress-controller (under the ingress-nginx namespace).
2. Under "spec -> template -> spec" add a Key:Value of "hostNetwork: true"

``` yaml
hostNetwork: true
```

## **ARs**
### **CaaS Roadmap & Risk Analysis**
Identify PO in CaaS to discuss their roadmap and engagement.

#### **Better Transparency**
Upgrade announcements to not only be in Yammer, but also with the Intel notification system. 

#### **Hold Future Upgrades**
Do not upgrade our Kubernetes & Rancher without getting explicit approval from us.

### **Future Proofing**
#### **Parallel Environments (High Availability)**
Make iBI work in parallel in 2 clusters (AMR & GER for both Dev and Prod).

That way, if an upgrade happens in makes issue in on Prod cluster, the other one will still be available (Like with Kafka).
