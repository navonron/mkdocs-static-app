# 2023-07-04 - Rancher 2.6.11

## **Summary**
CaaS Rancher 2.6.11 upgrade disrupted service discovery.

## **Details**
### **Notifications**

The Rancher 2.6 migration was postponed until now, despite being due a year or a year and a half ago.

Yammer message was posted (I wasn't alerted despite my subscription), and there were no other reminders..

I was OOO during versions 2.7 and 3.7.

## **Background**
Caas Team are upgrading Rancher in all environments (AMR and GER for us) from Rancher version 2.5.11 to 2.6.11.

- AMR: Monday July 3rd from 1PM to 5PM
- GER: Tuesday July 4th from 1PM to 5PM

During the Rancher upgrade, certain Rancher 2.5.11 features were removed.

The feature that directly impacts us is the DNS "discovery" feature for services, which is utilized by our helm chart for ibi-services.

In an effort to assist users, CaaS likely ran a conversion script or tool to transition all 2.5 "discovery" mechanisms to the supported options in 2.6.

## **Outcomes**
1.	Successful upgrade for some services.
2.	Breakage of certain services (listed below).
3.	Continued usage of the old mechanism by some services, which will result in breakage once the upgrade is completed.

## **Broken Services (fixed)**

        <td>DNS Discovery fixed. DB NFS issue fixed</td>
    </td>
</table>

## **Updates**
1.	ibi-daas-query-dev: DNS Discovery fixed, but DB still has issues.    

## **Important notes**
1.	The ibi services helm chart still uses the 2.5.11 mechanism. After today's Rancher upgrade, any service release will break due to the use of the old mechanism.
2.	DO NOT RUN SERVICE UPGRADE PIPELINES until the helm chart is updated by me with the Rancher 2.6 fix, as it will cause issues.

## **Good news**
A lot of critical service were not affected: Kafka Prod and Dev, Azure DevOps Agents, Logstash, Zookeeper, Cluster, SonarQube, Kafka UI, CMAK.

All AMR services survived the upgrade.


## **Action required (CaaS)**
1.	Add DNS "discovery" mechanism support to ibi-service-chart.
2.	Fix services using the old DNS "discovery" mechanism in GER and AMR.
3.	Upgrade the entire ibi k8s Production and Development environments (after 1,2 are complete), will need @Berkovitch, Sergey.
4.	Open a ticket to CaaS regarding the inability to manage "Old" Apps (Kafka Prod & Dev, Kafka-UI, Zookeeper, iBI Services in Production & Development, Logstash, ADO Agents, and more) from the new Rancher 2.6.11 UI.
5.	Migrate all "Catalogs" to "Repositories" (Rancher 2.5 -> 2.6).
6.	Other yet to discover Rancher migration needs..
