### Unresolved (All)

Will show you all the unresolved issue under your selected project (I recommend only using your board)

##### Distribution
Distributions are was to distribute queries into sub queries without making more requests to the Jira Server.

I recommend under the "Unresolved (All)" to add a distribution for "Assignee":

1. Click right click on the "Unresolved (All)"
2. Click on "Create Distribution"
3. Select "Assignee" from the list.

Click on the "Filter or group values" in the bottom left of the opened popup.

Pick only the assignees that you want to see from the list.
